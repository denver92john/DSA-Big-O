1. 
    a. constant time O(1)
    b. logarithmic time O(log n)
2. Constant time because no matter size of input, algorithm will take same amount of time to complete.
3. Polynomial time because there's nested loops.
4. Linear time because running times directly proportional to size of input.
5. Constant time because just acessing an array
6. Polynomial time because nested loops.
7. The algorithm prints out the fibonacci sequence and it's linear.
8. logarithmic
9. Constant
10. Algorithm tells if even or odd and its constant.
